1. Make a clean installation of FxSound (recommended). If you already have the  
program installed, then delete the following file:                              
                                                                                
C:\Users\<YOUR_USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\FxSound\FxSound.secure                
                                                                                
2. Once installed, close the program in case of have been started. Always check 
that the program is not minimized in the system tray.                           
                                                                                
3. Copy the provided DLL according to your OS platform (x86/x64) to the folder  
where you installed the program, next to "FxSound.exe".                         
                                                                                
4. Start the program. In the welcome screen click "Login here" and then enter   
any email you want (it doesn't have to be real). Finally, click on "Submit".    
                                                                                
5. Done. You can check your license status in "Settings" -> "Account".

IMPORTANT (MUST READ)

. There is no need to block the program with a firewall or hosts file, although 
you can do it anyway if you want.                                               
                                                                                
. You can change the email you are using at any time. Just go to "Settings" ->  
"Account" and click on "Logout/switch plan". Then close the program and repeat  
the above steps starting from point 4.                                          
                                                                                
. You can update the program safely, provided you keep the DLL file in the      
installation folder, it should work with newer versions too.                    
                                                                                
. If you have any issues with the program after installing the hook DLL (it     
crashes or it remains in free mode), try the following:                         
                                                                                
- If you have DEP enabled, add the program to the exclusion list.               
- If you have any Antivirus/Anti-Malware program, add the program/folder to the 
exclusion list.                                                                 
                                                                                
If none of the above works, probably it's necessary to update the hook DLL.

ANTIVIRUS & FALSE POSITIVES                                                     
иииииииииииииииииииииииииии                                                     
Some antivirus can detect this release as a threat and try to remove it. The    
reason for this is because my releases are packed/protected in order to reduce  
its size and avoid alterations to the code. This protection can be erroneously  
identified as a threat, it is what is commonly known as a FALSE POSITIVE. Just  
ignore it, it is safe to use.                                                   
                                                                                
IMPORTANT: there will be no risk when using my releases as long as you have     
downloaded it from the links posted on my site or from the "Check for Updates"  
option. If you have downloaded this release from another site, I CANNOT         
GUARANTEE ITS INTEGRITY. In such case, I will not take responsability for       
eventual problems that arise when using it. Be careful!                         
                                                                                
As a precaution, always check the release hashes.
